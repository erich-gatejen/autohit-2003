Use the calls to create, access, and destroy modules. They will be put<br>
in the VM persist. Each will have their own local variables (java scope).
<p>Module instances exist only with the VM that creates them. They do not have<br>
  to enforce thread safety, since it shouldn't be an issue for them. Therefore,<br>
  you should not try to find ways around this limitation. If you need VMs<br>
  to talk, use other mechanisms, instead of sharing Modules.</p>
<p>Modules should *NOT* implement any static fields!!! That could be very, <br>
  very bad.</p>
